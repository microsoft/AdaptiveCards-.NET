# Adaptive Cards

![logo](assets/adaptive-card-200.png)

[Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io) are a new way for developers to exchange content in a common and consistent way. Get started today by putting Adaptive Cards into Microsoft Teams, Outlook Actionable Messages, Cortana Skills, or Windows Timeline -- or render cards inside your own apps by using our SDKs.
